# GitHub User Activity CLI 🚀

A simple command-line tool to fetch and display the **recent activity** of any GitHub user using the GitHub API.

- Status messages and error alerts for better user experience.
- Rich-formatted CLI with color output
- Progress bar while fetching data
- 📌 Supports:
  - Pushed commits (`PushEvent`)
  - Opened issues (`IssuesEvent`)
  - Starred repositories (`WatchEvent`)
  - Forked repositories (`ForkEvent`)
  - Opened pull requests (`PullRequestEvent`)
- Stores the latest data for up to 10 users to reduce API calls.
